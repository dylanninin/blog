##Pastime Paradise 

	They've been spending most their lives
	Living in a pastime paradise
	They've been spending most their lives
	Living in a pastime paradise
	They've been wasting most their time
	Glorifying days long gone behind
	They've been wasting most their days
	In remembrance of ignorance oldest praise
	
	Tell me who of them will come to be
	How many of them are you and me
	Dissipation
	Race relations
	Consolation
	Segregation
	Dispensation
	Isolation
	Exploitation
	Mutilation
	Mutations
	Miscreation
	Confirmation...to the evils of the world
	
	They've been spending most their lives
	Living in a future paradise
	They've been spending most their lives
	Living in a future paradise
	They've been looking in their minds
	For the day that sorrows gone from time
	They keep telling of the day
	When the savior of love will come to stay
	
	Tell me who of them will come to be
	How many of them are you and me
	Proclamation
	Of race relations
	Consolation
	Integretion
	Verification
	Of revelations
	Acclamation
	World salvation
	Vibrations
	Stimulation
	Confirmation...to the peace of the world
	
	They've been spending most their lives
	Living in a pastime paradise
	They've been spending most their lives
	Living in a pastime paradise
	They've been spending most their lives
	Living in a future paradise
	They've been spending most their lives
	Living in a future paradise
	We've been spending too much of our lives
	Living in a pastime paradise
	
	Lets start living our lives
	Living for the future paradise
	Praise to our lives
	Living for the future paradise
	Shame to anyone's lives
	Living in the pastime paradise
